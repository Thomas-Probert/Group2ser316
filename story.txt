Story:
- Once upon a time, at the bustling Raesfeld Flughafen, a curious tourist named Mehlhase decided to embark on a quest to taste every Bratwurst in Berlin before his return flight.
- The road to the Flughafen is the Hauptstrasse, where people can cycle, jog and walk their Hund.
- As Mehlhase made his way down the Hauptstrasse, he couldn't resist stopping at a local Baeckerei to buy some freshly baked Brot for his journey.
- Continuing down Hauptstrasse, Mehlhase discovered a Biergarten by an old Schloss, where a lively contest at the Ratskeller challenged participants to create the wildest bratwurst flavors, ranging from Apfelkuchen to Doener spice.
- I see a lot of travellers rushing down the road to the airport in their cars. Those that drive BMW or Porsche must use the Klimaanlage.
- At the Biergarten, a group of friends dressed in traditional Dirndel and Lederhose were enjoying some Gebaeck while discussing their favorite Rammstein songs.
- Mehlhase joined the group, sharing tales of his Bratwurst quest, as laughter and Rammstein discussions filled the air.
- To anyone who wishes to travel via the Flughafen in future, I would recommend trying out the Apfelkuchen from one of the locations along the Hauptstrasse.
- As the sun set, the picturesque Schloss Eltz in the distance glowed with a magical allure, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the evening.
- Mehlhase, feeling content, captured the scene with a photo, forever preserving the memory of his quirky, flavor-filled adventure.
- As Melhasse returns to walk down the Hauptstrasse, a hund appears and begins to follow her.
- Melhasse goes back to the Biergarten, buys a bratwurst, and shares it with the hund.
-The hund was greedy however, and demanded doener as well!
